# Discord Bot for Physics Olympiad Lessons

This is the first Discord bot I ever created, designed specifically for a Physics Olympiad lessons Discord server. The bot was made to assist in maintaining and notifying class schedules. It uses the Zoom API to automatically create classes and notify students by sending direct messages (DMs).

## Features
- Automatically creates Zoom meetings and shares join links.
- Sends class schedules to students.
- Notifies students via DMs when a class is about to start.

## Notes
- This bot is **unmaintained** and might not be running anymore.
- The code is **not well-written** and could be improved significantly in terms of structure and readability. Use it as it is or as a starting point for further development.
